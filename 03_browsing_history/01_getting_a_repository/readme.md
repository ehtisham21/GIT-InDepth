# 📚 Setting Up Files for Browsing History Learning

Follow these simple steps to prepare the necessary files and get started with learning about browsing history. Everything is broken down for clarity and ease. 🚀

## 📖 Table of Contents

1. [Navigate to the Project Directory](#navigate-to-the-project-directory)
2. [Find the Required File](#find-the-required-file)
3. [Extract the Archive](#extract-the-archive)
4. [You're All Set!](#youre-all-set)

## 1. 🔍 Navigate to the Project Directory

Begin by changing into the `03_browsing_history` folder. This directory contains all the relevant resources you'll be working with.

```bash
cd 03_browsing_history
```

## 2. 📂 Find the Required File

Next, go into the `01_getting_a_repository` subdirectory and verify that the file `venus.zip` exists.

```bash
cd 01_getting_a_repository
ls
```

Running `ls` will list the contents of the directory so you can confirm the presence of `venus.zip`.

## 3. 📦 Extract the Archive

Once you've confirmed the ZIP file is present, extract it using the following command:

```bash
unzip venus.zip
```

If `unzip` is not installed on your system, here’s how to install it:

- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install unzip
  ```
- **macOS (with Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install unzip
  ```
- **Windows:**
  Use a tool like **WinRAR** or **7-Zip** to extract the file.

## 4. ✅ You're All Set!

Once extracted, the files will be ready for use. You can now begin working with the browsing history project. Happy learning!
