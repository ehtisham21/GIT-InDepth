## 🔍 What Are Git Tags?

Git tags help label specific commits—typically used for marking **releases**, **features**, or **milestones**. They allow easy navigation of your project history and version tracking.

There are **two main types** of tags:
- **Lightweight Tags**: Simple pointers to a commit.
- **Annotated Tags**: Include metadata like author, date, and message.

---

## 🏷️ Adding Tags

### ➤ Create a Lightweight Tag

A lightweight tag is a direct pointer to a commit, without extra details like messages or author info.

**Command:**
```
git tag v1.3 a642e12
```

📌 _This simply marks the commit with the name `v1.3`._

**Use Cases:**
- Temporary bookmarks
- Local-only tags
- Quick references

---

### ➤ Create an Annotated Tag

Annotated tags store extra info like your name, date, and a message—ideal for official releases.

**Command:**
```
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release" ca49180
```

📌 _This creates a tag `v1.0` with a message and author info._

**Use Cases:**
- Marking production releases
- Providing context on versions
- Verifying tags via GPG signing
