## 🛠️ How to View Commit Differences

Below are the most commonly used ways to compare changes between two commits.

---

### 1. `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD` 📄

**What it does:**  
Compares the state of the repo two commits ago (`HEAD~2`) with the current commit (`HEAD`). Shows exact line-by-line changes for each file.

**Why use it:**
- 🔍 Full diff output with code-level changes
- 🛠️ Great for detailed code reviews
- 📜 Easy to see what was added or removed

**Example Command:**
```bash
git diff HEAD~2 HEAD
```

**Example Output:**
```diff
diff --git a/src/Auth.js b/src/Auth.js
index e69de29..0d1d7fc 100644
--- a/src/Auth.js
+++ b/src/Auth.js
@@ -0,0 +1,10 @@
+// Authentication module
+import React from 'react';
+
+function Auth() {
+    // Authentication logic
+}
+
+export default Auth;
```

**Use Cases:**
- Spot bugs introduced in recent commits
- Review exactly what changed before merging
- Document changes for feature tracking

### 2. `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-only` 👤

**What it does:**  
Lists only the names of files that changed between `HEAD~2` and `HEAD`, without showing code changes.

**Why use it:**
- 📁 Fast overview of changed files
- 🚫 No detailed diffs
- 📋 Useful for automation or file-level audits

**Example Command:**
```bash
git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-only
```

**Example Output:**
```
src/Auth.js
src/UserProfile.js
README.md
```

**Use Cases:**
- Quickly identify affected areas of the project
- Feed file lists into build or deployment scripts
- Estimate the scope of a commit

---

### 3. `git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-status` 🗂️

**What it does:**  
Like `--name-only`, but also shows the type of change for each file (Modified, Added, Deleted).

**Why use it:**
- 📁 Lists files along with change types
- 📌 Adds context to each file change
- 📝 Ideal for summarized change reports

**Example Command:**
```bash
git diff HEAD~2 HEAD --name-status
```

**Example Output:**
```
M	src/Auth.js
A	src/UserProfile.js
D	src/OldComponent.js
```

**Use Cases:**
- Review what was added, updated, or removed
- Prepare reports or changelogs
- Quickly understand the nature of changes

## 📝 Conclusion

Using `git diff` with different options gives you the flexibility to inspect changes at the level of detail you need—whether you're doing a quick check or a thorough code review. Keep these variations in your Git toolkit to stay on top of changes in your project!
