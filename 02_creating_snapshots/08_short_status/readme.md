### 📝🔍 1. View Short Status  
Get a brief summary of the changes in your repo.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git status -s
```  
📝 **Explanation**  
`git status -s`: Shows changes in a short format — helpful for quick overviews.  

📋 **Example Output**  
```
?? file1.txt  
?? file2.txt
```
- `??`: Untracked files (not yet added to Git)

---

### ✏️📄 2. Append Text to a File  
Let’s add some content — for example, append "sky" to `moon/main.js`.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
echo sky >> moon/main.js
```  
📝 **Explanation**  
Adds "sky" at the end of `main.js`. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates it.

---

### 🆕📂 3. Make a New File  
Create a file with content in one step.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
echo mountains > moon/file2.js
```  
📝 **Explanation**  
Creates `file2.js` inside `moon/` with "mountains" as its content.

### 📋🔎 4. View Full Status  
See a detailed list of all changes in your working directory.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git status
```  
📝 **Explanation**  
Shows all staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

📋 **Example Output**

```

---

### 📝🔍 5. Check Short Status Again  
Use the short format again to review current changes.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git status -s
```  
📋 **Example Output**  
```
MM moon/main.js  
?? moon/file2.js
```
- `MM`: File modified and partially staged.  
- `??`: New untracked file.

---

### ➕📂 6. Stage a Modified File  
Move a file to the staging area before committing.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git add moon/main.js
```  
📝 **Explanation**  
Stages `main.js` changes for commit.

💡 Tip: Use `git add -u` or `git add .` to stage all files.

---

### 📝🔍 7. Check Short Status After Staging  
Make sure the file is staged.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git status -s
```  
📋 **Example Output**  
```
M  moon/main.js  
?? moon/file2.js
```
- `M`: File staged.  
- `??`: File still untracked.

### ✏️📄 8. Append More to the File  
Add new content to the same file.  

📌 **Command**

?? moon/file2.js
```
- First `M`: Staged  
- Second `M`: New unstaged changes

---

### ➕📂 10. Stage Again  
Stage the file again to include the latest changes.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git add moon/main.js
```  
📝 **Explanation**  
Adds the new change in `main.js` to staging.

💡 Tip: Frequently stage your work for clarity.

---

### 📝🔍 11. Final Status Check  
Confirm all changes are fully staged.  

📌 **Command**  
```bash
git status -s
```  
📋 **Example Output**
