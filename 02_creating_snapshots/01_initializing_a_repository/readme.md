**Getting Started with Git: A Simple 3-Step Process**
====================================================

### Quick Guide

1. [Create a Project Directory](#create-a-project-directory)
2. [Change into the Directory](#change-into-the-directory)
3. [Set up Git](#set-up-git)

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Create a Project Directory

To start a new project, create a directory using the `mkdir` command. For example, let's create a directory named "Mars".

```bash
mkdir Mars
```

#### 2. Change into the Directory

Move into the newly created directory using the `cd` command.

```bash
cd Mars
```

#### 3. Set up Git

Initialize a Git repository in your project directory using the `git init` command. This creates a `.git` folder to track changes and version history.

```bash
git init
```

### What's Next?

* A new `.git` subdirectory is created.
* This subdirectory contains Git repository files.
* Your project isn't tracked yet; add files to start tracking changes.

### Recap

* Create a directory with `mkdir`.
* Change into the directory with `cd`.
* Set up Git with `git init`.

You're done! Your project directory is now a Git repository, ready for collaboration and version control.
