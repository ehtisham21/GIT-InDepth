## 1. 🧹 Remove File from Directory

Remove a file from your working directory using a system command such as `rm`.

### 🛠 Example

```bash
rm file2.txt
```

### 📝 What This Does

- `rm file2.txt`: Deletes `file2.txt` from your local directory.
- ⚠️ **Note**: This deletion is permanent unless the file is backed up or versioned.

---

## 2. 🔍 Check Staging Area

After deleting a file, check its status with Git:

```bash
git status
```

### 📋 Example Output

```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        deleted:    file2.txt
```

### ✅ Explanation

- Git recognizes that `file2.txt` has been deleted and staged for removal.

---

## 3. ❌ Remove from Staging Area

If you change your mind, unstage the deletion using:

```bash
git add file2.txt
```

### 📝 What This Does

- Reverses the deletion *from Git’s staging area* (not the filesystem).
- To restore the file on disk:

```bash
git restore file2.txt
```

---

## 4. ✍️ Commit Changes

Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit the deletion:

```bash
git commit -m "Remove file2.txt"
```

### ✅ Explanation

- `git commit`: Records the staged deletion.
- `-m`: Adds a clear message describing the removal.

💡 **Tip**: Use meaningful commit messages for better project tracking.

---

## 5. 🔄 Check Staging Area Again

After committing, confirm that the file is no longer tracked:

```bash
git ls-files
```

### 📋 Example Output

```
README.md
file1.txt
```

### ✅ Explanation

- `file2.txt` should no longer appear—indicating successful removal from Git.

---

## 6. 🛠️ Using `git rm` Command

Alternatively, remove and stage the file in one command:

```bash
git rm file2.txt
```

### 📝 What This Does

- Removes `file2.txt` from both your directory and Git staging area in one step.

⚠️ **Note**: Use with care—this permanently deletes the file unless it's backed up.

### ✅ Commit the Change

```bash
git commit -m "Remove file2.txt using git rm"
```

## 📝 Summary

| Step | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 🧹 Delete File | `rm file2.txt` | Removes file from your directory |
| 🔍 Check Status | `git status` | Shows deleted file staged |
| ❌ Unstage Deletion | `git add file2.txt` | Cancels the staged removal |
| ✍️ Commit | `git commit -m "message"` | Finalizes file removal |
| 🔄 Verify | `git ls-files` | Confirms file is no longer tracked |
| ⚡ One-Step Option | `git rm file2.txt` | Deletes and stages in one command |

---

✅ **Recommendation:** Use `git rm` for efficient cleanup, but verify changes before committing to avoid unintentional deletions.
