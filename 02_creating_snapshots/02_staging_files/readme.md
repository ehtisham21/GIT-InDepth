## 1. Creating Files
Before you can stage files, you need to create them. Here, we'll create two simple text files using the `echo` command:

```bash
echo "Hello World!" > file1.txt
echo "Hello World!" > file2.txt
```

### 🔍 What These Commands Do:
- `echo "Hello World!" > file1.txt`  
  → Creates a file named `file1.txt` with the content `Hello World!`.
- `echo "Hello World!" > file2.txt`  
  → Creates a second file named `file2.txt` with the same content.

## 2. Viewing Git Status
Check the current state of your working directory and staging area with:

```bash
git status
```

### 🧾 Sample Output:
```
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        file1.txt
        file2.txt
```

### 📌 Explanation:
- **Untracked files**: These are new files Git hasn’t started tracking yet. They will appear in red and won’t be included in commits unless staged.

## 3. Staging Files
Now it's time to stage the files you want to include in your next commit using the `git add` command.

### ✅ Options to Stage Files:

#### 🔹 Stage All `.txt` Files
```bash
git add *.txt
```
Adds all `.txt` files in the current directory to the staging area.

#### 🔹 Stage a Specific File
```bash
git add file1.txt
```
Stages only `file1.txt`, leaving other files unstaged.

#### 🔹 Stage Everything in the Current Directory
```bash
git add .
```
Stages all changes in the current directory — including new, modified, and deleted files.

#### 🔹 Stage All Repository-Wide Changes
```bash
git add -A
```
Adds all changes (in all directories) to the staging area.

## 4. Confirming Staged Files
After staging, run `git status` again to confirm which files have been staged:

```bash
git status
```

### 🧾 Sample Output:
```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   file1.txt
        new file:   file2.txt
```

### 📌 Explanation:
- **Changes to be committed**: These are the files currently staged and ready to be included in your next commit. They will appear in green.
