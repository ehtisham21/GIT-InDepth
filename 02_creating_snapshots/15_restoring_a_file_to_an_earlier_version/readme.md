### Summary

### 1. Remove the File from the Repository

Before restoring a file to an earlier version, you may need to remove it from the repository. This step ensures that the file is deleted from both the working directory and the staging area.

**Command**
```bash
git rm moon/file.js
```
**Example**
```bash
git rm moon/file.js
```
**Explanation**

*   `git rm moon/file.js`: Removes the file `file.js` from the `moon` directory in both the working directory and the staging area.

**What This Does:**

*   **Working Directory**: Deletes the physical file from your local machine.
*   **Staging Area**: Marks the file for removal in the next commit.

**Tip**: Ensure that you truly want to remove the file before executing this command, as it will delete the file from your working directory.

### 2. Commit the Changes

After removing the file, you need to commit the change to update the repository's history. This records the removal of the file in the project's commit history.

**Command**
```bash
git commit -m "Remove file.js"
```
**Example**
```bash
git commit -m "Remove file.js"
```
**Explanation**

*   `git commit -m "Remove file.js"`: Commits the staged changes with the message "Remove file.js".

**What This Does:**

*   **Commit Message**: Clearly documents the removal of `file.js`, aiding in future reference and collaboration.

**Tip**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages to maintain an understandable project history.

### 3. View Help Information for Restore

Familiarize yourself with the `git restore` command by viewing its help information. This provides details on available options and usage patterns.

**Command**
```bash
git restore -h
```
**Example**
```bash
git restore -h
```
**Explanation**

*   `git restore -h`: Displays the help information for the `git restore` command, outlining its various options and usage scenarios.

**What This Does:**

*   **Help Documentation**: Provides a summary of commands and flags available for `git restore`, assisting in effective usage.

**Tip**: Reviewing help information is a good practice to understand the capabilities and syntax of Git commands.

### 4. Restore File to an Earlier Version

Finally, restore the file to its state from a previous commit using the `git restore` command. This brings back the file as it was at the specified commit.

**Command**
```bash
git restore --source=HEAD~1 moon/file.js
```
**Example**
```bash
git restore --source=HEAD~1 moon/file.js
```
**Explanation**

*   `git restore --source=HEAD~1 moon/file.js`: Restores the file `file.js` in the `moon` directory to its state from one commit before the current HEAD.

**What This Does:**

*   `--source=HEAD~1`: Specifies the commit from which to restore the file. `HEAD~1` refers to the immediate parent commit of the current HEAD.
*   **File Restoration**: Reverts `file.js` to how it existed in the specified commit, effectively undoing changes made in subsequent commits.

**Warning**: Restoring files to earlier versions can overwrite current changes. Ensure that you do not need the latest modifications before performing this action.

**Tip**: To restore multiple files or entire directories, specify their paths accordingly or use wildcards as needed.
