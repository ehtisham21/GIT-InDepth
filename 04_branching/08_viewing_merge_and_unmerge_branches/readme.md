## 🔍 Overview

Branches in Git help separate different development efforts—such as features or bug fixes. Over time, unused branches may clutter your repo. Knowing which ones are merged and which are not helps keep things clean. 🧹

This guide explains:

- ✅ How to see which branches are merged
- 🗑️ How to safely delete merged branches
- 🚧 How to identify branches that haven’t been merged yet

---

## ✅ Merged Branches

Merged branches have already been incorporated into the active branch (like `main` or `master`). You can usually delete them without issues.

### 1. View Merged Branches 📄

**Purpose:**  
See which branches have been integrated into the current branch.

**Command:**
```bash
git branch --merged
```

**Example Output:**
```
  bugfix/about
  feature/password
* master
```

**Explanation:**
- `bugfix/about` and `feature/password` are now part of `master`.
- The `*` indicates your current branch.

**When to Use:**
- 🧼 Clean your repo by removing branches already merged.
- ✅ Confirm merges before deleting.
- 👥 Notify teammates about merge status.

**Visual:**
```
* master
  bugfix/about
  feature/password
```

### 2. Delete Merged Branches 🗑️

**Purpose:**  
Remove branches that have already been merged into the current branch.

**Commands:**
```bash
git branch -d bugfix/about
git branch -d feature/password
```

**Explanation:**
- `-d` deletes the branch *only if* it’s already merged—safe and smart.

**Example Output:**
```
Deleted branch bugfix/about (was a1b2c3d).
Deleted branch feature/password (was d4e5f6g).
```

**When to Use:**
- 🧽 Regular cleanup
- ❌ Remove unnecessary or mistaken branches
- 🗂️ Keep the branch list relevant

**Post-deletion Visual:**
```
* master
```

⚠️ **Force Delete (Unmerged Branches):**

**Command:**
```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
git branch -D feature/experimental
```

**When to Use:**
- 🧪 Discard experimental or unneeded branches

---

## 🚧 Unmerged Branches

Branches not yet merged into the current branch may still need review, development, or merging.

### 1. View Unmerged Branches 📋

**Purpose:**  
List branches that haven’t been merged into the current one.

**Command:**
```bash
git branch --no-merged
```

**Scenario Example:**
- `main`: mainline branch
- `feature/login`: pending merge
- `feature/signup`: in progress

**Example Output:**
```
  feature/login
  feature/signup
```

**Explanation:**
- These are still outside `main`.

**When to Use:**
- 🔍 Check what's pending
- 📅 Plan upcoming merges
- 📢 Communicate remaining work to the team

**Visual:**
```
  feature/login
  feature/signup
* main
```

| `git branch --merged`      | Shows branches merged into current branch        | `bugfix/about`, `feature/password`, `* master` |
| `git branch -d <name>`     | Deletes merged branch                            | Deleted branch info                            |
| `git branch --no-merged`   | Lists branches not yet merged                    | `feature/login`, `feature/signup`              |
| `git branch -D <name>`     | Force deletes any branch (even if unmerged)      | Deleted branch info                            |

🛡️ Key Reminders:
- Use `-d` for safe deletion of merged branches
- Regularly inspect and clean up branches
- Follow naming conventions for clarity

## 💡 Helpful Tips

- **Show All Branches (local & remote):**
  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```
  See everything you're working with.

- **Check Branch Status Before Deleting:**
  ```bash
  git show-branch <branch-name>
  ```

- **Clean Up Remote Branches:**
  ```bash
  git fetch --prune
  ```

- **Name Branches Clearly:**
  Use names like `feature/login`, `bugfix/logout`, `release/v1.0` for clarity.

- **Use Git Extensions:**
  Tools like GitLens in VS Code help visualize merged/unmerged branches.

- **Automate Cleanup:**
  Use scripts or Git hooks to clean up merged branches regularly.
