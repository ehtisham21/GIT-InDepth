## 🔍 Overview

Branching in Git lets you work on features, bug fixes, or experiments independently from your main codebase. This modular approach to development supports collaboration, version control, and clean integration of changes.

---

## 🧰 Step-by-Step Branching Workflow

### 1. 🧾 List All Branches

To see which branches exist in your repository:

```bash
git branch
```

📌 **Output Example**:
```
* main
  feature/login
  bugfix/logout
  release/v1.0
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Identify available branches
- Check the current branch
- Prepare to switch or delete branches

---

### 2. 🌱 Create a New Branch

To create a new branch named `bugfix-logout`:

```bash
git branch bugfix-logout
```

📌 **Output**: *(No output if successful)*

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Isolate a feature or fix
- Avoid impacting the main branch

---

### 3. 🔄 Switch to a Branch

Switch to your new branch to start working:

```bash
git switch bugfix-logout
```

📌 **Output**:
```
Switched to branch 'bugfix-logout'
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Start developing in your new branch
- Maintain separation from the main line of development

---

### 4. 🏷️ Rename a Branch

If you want to rename the branch for clarity:

```bash
git branch -m bugfix-logout bugfix/logout-form
```

📌 **Output**:
```
Renamed branch 'bugfix-logout' to 'bugfix/logout-form'
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Clarify branch purpose
- Follow naming conventions

---

### 5. ✏️ Make File Changes

Open and edit the file (e.g., `audience.txt`):

```bash
code audience.txt
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Fix bugs
- Add or modify features
- Improve code clarity

---

### 6. 💾 Stage and Commit Changes

Add and commit your changes:

```bash
git add audience.txt
git commit -m "Fix logout functionality issue"
```

📌 **Output**:
```
[bugfix/logout-form a1b2c3d] Fix logout functionality issue
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Record changes
- Document updates clearly

---

### 7. 📜 View Branch Commits

Check commits in your current branch:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

📌 **Output**:
```
a1b2c3d Fix logout functionality issue
d4e5f6g Add logout form validation
g7h8i9j Update logout route in backend
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Track progress
- Review changes before merging

---

### 8. 🔙 Switch to Main Branch

Return to the main branch:

```bash
git switch main
```

📌 **Output**:
```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Merge your work
- Start a new task

---

### 9. 🗑️ Delete a Branch

Once the branch is merged or no longer needed:

```bash
git branch -d bugfix/logout-form  # Safe delete
git branch -D bugfix/logout-form  # Force delete
```

📌 **Output**:
```
Deleted branch bugfix/logout-form (was a1b2c3d).
```

✅ **Use Cases**:
- Clean up old branches
- Maintain an organized repo

---

## 💡 Additional Tips

- 🔍 **View All (Including Remote)**:
  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```

- 🚀 **Create & Switch in One Command**:
  ```bash
  git switch -c feature/new-ui
  ```

- 🔀 **Merge Branch into Main**:
  ```bash
  git switch main
  git merge bugfix/logout-form
  ```

- 🧹 **Rebase to Keep History Clean**:
  ```bash
  git switch bugfix/logout-form
  git rebase main
  ```

- 🧠 **Naming Best Practices**:
  - `feature/login-page`
  - `bugfix/logout-issue`
  - `release/v1.1`

- 🛠️ **Use Git Tools**:
  - GitLens (VS Code)
  - GitKraken
  - SourceTree
